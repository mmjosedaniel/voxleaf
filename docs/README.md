## Current project status

Roadmap Milestones 1 through 9 are complete. M008 provides the constrained one-GPU narration demo: bounded narration preparation from the active visual locator, one-at-a-time M007 synthesis, sole-owner in-memory buffering, Web Audio playback, and accessible quick/prepared controls. The final policy keeps quick start as the default, one minute as the initial prepared and refill target, 10 seconds as low water, `0` ms as the boundary-wait default, `1.0x` playback, and the simultaneous 30-minute ceiling. M009 adds segment-level audible progress, one non-mutating focus-safe reader highlight/follow projection, identity-first synchronized navigation, non-skipping heard checkpoints, and exact-host packaged validation. The final synchronized run observed six segment transitions, no stale playback, 0.7 ms p95 follow, one natural underrun/refill, 190 ms cancellation, bounded cleanup, zero generated-audio files, and zero external requests. Its 378.46 buffering seconds per playback minute remains exact-host performance evidence, not a production claim, so ADR-0013's standard-profile blocker remains. A later manual real-publication run did not visibly show the active segment highlight and confirmed that the opened-book page could place the reader below the application controls. M009.1 Milestones 1-2 freeze paint-aware authority and repair the same-chapter materialization gap; PR #138 closes their clean-host validation. Milestone 3 implements one dedicated reader scroll viewport, stable compact application/publication/narration chrome, collapsible detail, and exact loaded/target/estimate text without a progress bar. Milestone 4 implements the bounded locator-backed paragraph leaf. Milestone 5 exact-host work validates the shell and narration loop and now keeps passive viewport inspection separate from active narration: the leaf retargets to an inspected paragraph as an actionable preview, and only clicking it replaces narration. Corrective exact-host confirmation and final M009.1 closeout remain. M010 hardware profiles, fallback, and resilience follows M009.1; general hardware support is not yet implemented. Required Ubuntu and Windows pull-request checks passed for completed roadmap milestones.
