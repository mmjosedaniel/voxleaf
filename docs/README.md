- [`product/project-brief.md`](product/project-brief.md): detailed problem, intended experience, product boundaries, and candidate technical direction.
- [`product/mvp.md`](product/mvp.md): MVP scope, non-goals, constraints, and acceptance criteria.
- [`product/glossary.md`](product/glossary.md): shared terminology.

## Architecture

- [`architecture/system-diagram.md`](architecture/system-diagram.md): canonical implemented/approved component map, EPUB-to-audio flow, status legend, and maintenance conditions.
- [`architecture/overview.md`](architecture/overview.md): detailed component boundaries, invariants, and implemented EPUB/shared-contract behavior.
- [`architecture/performance-budget.md`](architecture/performance-budget.md): latency, buffering, memory, and measurement targets.
- [`architecture/decisions/`](architecture/decisions/): durable architecture decisions.

## Development
