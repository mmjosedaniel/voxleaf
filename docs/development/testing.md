# Testing strategy

## Principles

- Test observable behavior.
- Keep tests deterministic.
- Use synthetic or public-domain text.
- Never require proprietary EPUBs or committed model weights.
- Separate correctness tests from hardware-dependent performance benchmarks.

## Deterministic foundation checks

Run `pnpm.cmd check` from native Windows after the locked JavaScript and Python environments are installed. It is the authoritative local foundation check and covers formatting, linting, type checking, smoke tests, framework-independent package builds, the React production build, the native Tauri release executable, and the Python source and wheel distributions.

GitHub Actions runs the same authoritative check in the `Windows native foundation` job on `windows-2025`. The separate `Ubuntu portable foundation` job runs `pnpm check:portable` on `ubuntu-24.04`, covering TypeScript and Python validation plus the browser-only desktop build without installing Rust or Linux desktop dependencies. A portable success does not replace native Windows validation.

Both jobs install from committed lockfiles. They do not use repository secrets, model weights, GPU hardware, books, generated audio, network services, or performance benchmarks. Network access is limited to tool and dependency installation before the deterministic checks execute.

### Implemented foundation tests

The current deterministic tests are deliberately small:

- `packages/shared/src/index.test.ts` proves that the shared production and test-support subpaths resolve independently and that fixed test identifiers are not exposed from the production root.
- `packages/shared/src/primitives/*.test.ts` verify opaque identifier separation, numeric-unit separation, JSON-compatible bounds, and supported schema-version handling without private input in errors.
- `packages/shared/src/contracts/book.test.ts` verifies versioned book identity, ordered spine metadata, local resources, navigation relationships, malformed structures, unsupported versions, and content-free errors using only synthetic values.
- `packages/shared/src/contracts/locator.test.ts` verifies content-free locator round trips, optional progression, closed versioned anchors, deterministic range ordering, cross-book rejection, and content-free errors without resolving an EPUB.
- `packages/shared/src/contracts/persisted-reading-state.test.ts` verifies deterministic content-free state round trips, matching book and locator identities, closed minimal preferences, unsupported-version handling, no coercion, private-path rejection, and content-free errors without reading or writing storage.
- `packages/shared/src/contracts/reading-session.test.ts` verifies versioned active-session decoding, distinct session/generation identities, deterministic active versus stale eligibility, separate cancellation intent, malformed-identity rejection, and content-free errors without invoking a queue, process, or model.
- `packages/shared/src/contracts/narration-segment.test.ts` verifies synthetic locator-linked narration segments, stable segment/session/generation identities, ordered source ranges, strict nonempty text and sequence validation, nested-version handling, and errors that do not expose sensitive narration text. It does not select normalization, segmentation, language, or prosody behavior.
- `packages/shared/src/contracts/operational-error.test.ts` verifies the closed operational-error taxonomy, fixed category and recoverable/fatal semantics, version handling, and rejection of free-form messages, content, audio, stacks, and private paths.
- `packages/shared/src/contracts/capability-report.test.ts` verifies explicit supported, unsupported, and unknown states for every model-independent v1 feature, closed-field compatibility, version handling, and rejection of model, device, vendor, path, or content details without probing real hardware.
- `packages/shared/src/contracts/audio-frame.test.ts` verifies payload-free frame metadata, branded ownership identities, exact sample-derived whole-millisecond calculations, aggregate-before-truncation behavior, numeric and duration-overflow boundaries, contiguous sequencing, unique frame IDs, stable format, segment termination, and content-free errors without audio devices or payloads.
- `pnpm.cmd --filter @voxleaf/shared generate:check` deterministically verifies that committed TypeScript wire DTOs match the canonical JSON Schema files.
- `packages/epub/src/index.test.ts` proves that the isolated EPUB package builds and resolves without adding archive, DOM, sanitizer, renderer, or locator behavior.
- `apps/desktop/src/App.test.tsx` renders the React shell in jsdom and verifies an accessible main landmark and heading.
- `services/tts/tests/test_health.py` imports the Python package and verifies its version function without loading a model, opening a server, using audio, or requiring hardware.
- `cargo test` validates the native crate's test harness and compilation. The minimal Rust shell currently contains zero Rust unit tests because it has no domain behavior.

The formatting, linting, type-checking, and production builds in `pnpm.cmd check` are deterministic validation stages, but they are not substitutes for behavior tests once product logic exists.

### Focused test commands

Run these from the repository root in native Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
pnpm.cmd --filter @voxleaf/shared test
pnpm.cmd --filter @voxleaf/epub test
pnpm.cmd --filter @voxleaf/desktop test
cargo test --manifest-path apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml
uv run --project services/tts --locked pytest services/tts
```

## Deferred coverage

No current test opens or renders an EPUB, creates or restores a reading locator, starts a TTS model, communicates across a process boundary, generates or plays audio, persists reading state, detects hardware, measures performance, builds an installer, or exercises an end-to-end reader flow. The examples below are requirements for later roadmap milestones, not claims about current coverage.

## Test levels

### Unit

Examples:

- EPUB path validation.
- Text normalization.
- Sentence and paragraph chunking.
- Queue bounds and ordering.
- Reading-session invalidation.
- Buffer calculations.
- Position persistence.
- Reading-locator serialization, resolution, and nearest-valid fallback.
- Reflow calculations preserve the logical reading location.
- Startup gating uses playable audio duration rather than elapsed wall-clock time.

### Integration

Examples:

- EPUB navigation and spine extraction from a small safe fixture.
- Mapping between sanitized rendered content, semantic chunks, and stable reading locators.
- Desktop-to-TTS protocol.
- TTS service lifecycle.
- Cancellation across the process boundary.
- Audio frame ordering.

### End to end

Critical journeys:

- Open a valid EPUB.
- Display it as a readable reflowable ebook rather than a plain narration transcript.
- Navigate to a passage, close the book, reopen it, and verify that the same passage is visible.
- Start playback.
- Verify that narration starts from the visible passage and keeps the active paragraph on screen.
- Verify that playback starts as soon as approximately 15 seconds of playable audio is buffered, without a fixed 15-second delay.
- Pause and resume.
- Seek to another paragraph.
- Change chapters.
- Recover from model-loading failure.
- Close the book and release resources.

### Performance

Report separately:

- Cold model load.
- Warm time to first audio.
- Playable audio depth when playback starts.
- Delay between satisfying the initial audio threshold and audible playback.
- Real-time factor.
- Buffer underrun frequency and duration.
- Cancellation latency.
- CPU, GPU, VRAM, and RAM use.

Performance tests may be hardware-specific, but their input text and procedure must be reproducible.

## Fixtures

Fixtures must be:

- Synthetic and committed directly.
- Public-domain with provenance documented.
- Small enough for fast deterministic tests.
